These are the baseline simulations described in the NW2 paper (add citation later). There are two sets of runs:

* _hmix5, where HMIX_FIXED = HMIX_STRESS =  5.0 m;
* _hmix20, where HMIX_FIXED = HMIX_STRESS =  20.0 m.

TODO: update description of runs (length of the runs, procedure for initializing interfaces from lower resolution run, etc).
