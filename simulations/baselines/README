These are the baseline simulations described in the NW2 manuscript (Marques et al., 2022) [TOD: add link]. There are two sets of runs:

* _hmix5, where HMIX_FIXED = HMIX_STRESS =  5.0 m;
* _hmix20, where HMIX_FIXED = HMIX_STRESS =  20.0 m.

Only runs labeled _hmix5 have been used in Marques et al., (2022). Please refer to this manuscript for a complete description 
on the configuration, spinup procedure, and analysis conducted.
